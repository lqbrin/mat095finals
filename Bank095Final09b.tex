{
	Find the equation of the line that passes through $(-8,4)$ and is perpendicular to the line $y=4x+12$.
}
{
	\begin{tabular}{l r}
	Slope of the line $y=4x+12$ is 4 & 1 pt to here \\
	Perpendicular slope: $m= -1/4$ & 2 pts to here\\
	$4 = -\dfrac{1}{4}(-8) + b$ &  3 pts to here\\
	$4 =  2 + b$ so $b = 2$ & 4 pts to here\\
	$y=\dfrac{-1}{4} x+2$     & 5 pts total\\
	\end{tabular}
